# SproutGit Docs Index

This file is the maintained entry point for the `docs/` folder.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this index whenever a document in `docs/` is added, renamed, removed, or substantially repurposed.

## Agent Workflow

On a new task:

1. Read this file first.
2. Identify which linked docs are relevant to the request.
3. Read those docs before making design or implementation decisions.

## Document Catalog

### Product And Workflow

- [requirements.md](requirements.md) — MVP scope, core UX principles, prescribed workspace layout, and default worktree-first product expectations.
- [branch-worktree-policy.md](branch-worktree-policy.md) — Branch/worktree binding rules, managed vs persistent branch policy, merge flow, and cleanup semantics.
- [worktree-hooks.md](worktree-hooks.md) — Proposed worktree lifecycle hook model, trigger semantics, scope, and constraints.
- [design-review-and-screen-plan.md](design-review-and-screen-plan.md) — Screen inventory, route flow, and UI architecture for the MVP.

### Architecture And Platform

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — Backend git/system command architecture, validator pipeline, composability analysis, and extension guidance.
- [docs-platform-plan.md](docs-platform-plan.md) — Documentation-site strategy, information architecture, search plan, and contribution model for long-form docs.

### Security

- [security-audit.md](security-audit.md) — Security review of git/system interactions, risks found, and backend hardening decisions.

### Testing, QA, And Benchmarks

- [benchmark-repository-strategy.md](benchmark-repository-strategy.md) — Strategy for sample repositories used in screenshots, demos, regression validation, and performance testing.
